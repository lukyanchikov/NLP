(2) Using the OS terminal, navigate to the working folder and type: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

(3) Using Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the working folder and open the `stroke_prediction.ipynb` notebook

(4) Edit the `path=r'C:\Users\slukyanc\Desktop\Machine Learning with Python Labs'` line by substituting the OS path to your working folder

# Running

(1) Edit the run parameter values in the `#Run by defining the parameter values:` section (scroll down or use Find to reach it)

(2) Use the `Run All` command in the `Cell` menu in Jupyter Notebook

(3) Review the outputs produced under the `#Run by defining the parameter values:` section (NB: the very last output - simulation of accuracy - may take 1-2 minutes to appear, the simulation progress is indicated by the `... out of 10 simulation runs completed.` messages displayed in the `#Simulate accuracy:` section)
